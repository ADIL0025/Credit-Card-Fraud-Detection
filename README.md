# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
**Dataset :-** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

This repository implements machine learning algorithms in Python to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It aims to assist financial institutions in identifying suspicious activity and protecting their customers from financial losses.

**Key Features**

1. _Multiple Machine Learning Models_ : Explore various algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and others (feel free to specify the models you've implemented). This allows for evaluation and selection of the best performing model for your specific dataset.

2. _Imbalanced Class Handling_ : Credit card fraud data is often imbalanced, with a much larger number of genuine transactions compared to fraudulent ones. The code incorporates techniques (mention specific techniques if used, e.g., SMOTE) to address this imbalance and improve model performance.

3. _Evaluation Metrics_ : Go beyond basic accuracy to assess model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve). These metrics provide a more comprehensive picture of how well the model identifies both fraud and legitimate transactions.

4. _Clear and Concise Code_ : The code adheres to Pythonic conventions and best practices for readability and maintainability.

**_Getting Started_**

 -Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (list specific libraries, e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, imblearn) installed. You can install them using 
 ```bash
pip install <library_name>
```

-Replace ```creditcardfraud.csv``` with your actual credit card transaction dataset. Ensure the data format (CSV, etc.) and column names are compatible.

-Run the provided Python script(s) (mention script names, e.g., ```main.py```). This will train, evaluate, and potentially visualize the performance of the models.
